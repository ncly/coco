Financial crises have led to higher regulatory standards on the capital adequacy of banks. Banks are required to hold more capital with loss absorbance capacities on their balance sheet. In conjunction with this development, contingent convertible bonds (CoCos) have become an attractive instrument for banks to seek new capital. The defining characteristic of CoCos is the automatic conversion into common equity when a predetermined trigger is met. Loss absorbing capital is created, which instantly improves the capital structure of the distressed bank. However, the pricing of these hybrid instruments remains opaque. In this context, the thesis scrutinizes the valuation of CoCos. Three dominant approaches are examined: the structural approach in accordance to \citet{pennacchi2010structural}, the credit derivatives approach and the equity derivatives approach both pursuant to \citet{de2011pricing}. The application covers sensitivity analysis to further understand the dynamics of the different methodologies. Based on a case study the viability of those approaches is evaluated. Software is provided for further replication.
